              The accordion&apos;s basic form is believed to have been invented
              in Berlin, in 1822, by Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann,
              although one instrument was discovered in 2006 that appears to
              have been built earlier. The earliest history of the accordion in
              Russia is poorly documented.
